Steven Pinker's [_The Sense of Style_](http://amzn.to/1ds9JdT) is different from other books on English. Pinker doesn't list a bunch of rules you have to follow to be a good writer. Pinker explains how the mind parses the written word, and how a writer can make it easy.

More important than grammar is logic. Bad logic always leads to bad prose. But sometimes good logic leads to bad prose. Why? The most common cause is the  _the curse of knowledge_.

> The better you know something, the less you remember about how hard it was to learn. The curse of knowledge is the single best explanation I know of why good people write bad prose.

But grammar is still important. A lot of grammar mistakes are not failures in logic. In fact, they're sometimes more logical than correct English. When someone says they "writed" something (as opposed to "wrote"), they are following an English pattern that for illogical reasons doesn't hold in a particular case.

> That's right: when it comes to correct English, there's no one in charge; the lunatics are running the asylum.

Pinker doesn't leave us in anarchy. He gives us ways to reason about grammar, word choices, and punctuation.

He explains how humans parse the written word: we read it as a tree. Pinker uses this model throughout the book to help us understand why some writing is difficult to understand.

Pinker uses real examples to explain his concepts. He doesn't shy away from attacking popular works. Pinker is respectful, but draws little blood; it makes the book fun. 

> Keegan is among the most esteemed military historians who ever lived, and _A History of Warfare_ was a critically acclaimed bestseller... Nevertheless, I found this paragraph barely coherent. (Referring to an excerpt from Keegan's book.)

A book about writing can be boring (look at a high-school English textbook). Pinker breaks up his writing with anecdotes, jokes, and comics. It makes the book easy to read.

[_The Sense of Style_](http://amzn.to/1ds9JdT) is the best book I've read on English. I've always been bad at prose. During college, I rarely got a paper back without at least a half dozen red marks (usually comma abuse). It's nice to find a book that uses logic to explain a subject that's been so difficult for me.
